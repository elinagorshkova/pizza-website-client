# Pizza Restaurant Mockup website
Lately I had been mostly focused on sharpening my algorithmic and computer science knowledge rather that Front End skills, the classic CSS/HTML/JS combination.

This project can bee seen as a showcase of my web design and web development expertise and my ability to bring a PDS design to a live website - essential skill for a modern Front End Engineer.
